### THIS WILL WORK ONLY IF YOUR PACKAGE MANAGER IS `APT`
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade  && sudo apt full-upgrade 
sudo apt autopurge  && sudo apt autoremove  && sudo apt autoclean 
sudo aptitude purge ~c  # This to remove all UNUSED apps or packages and just it :]
### This if you have flatpak then remove the `#` at the beginning next line :] IF you don't have flatpak just keep it OR remove ALL NEXT LINE(NOT RECOMMENDED)
#sudo flatpak update  
### To run this programe use 'bash upgrade.sh' or use `chmod u+x update.sh` to run './upgrade.sh' without use bash every time
sudo -k  # This to exit the super user mode (root account)
### NOTE : you can return it run every time you login (AUTOMATIC) but this you need to figure out by yourself SOME SEARSH WON't HURT YOU  ^_^
